-----
0.6.0
-----

* Change the interpretation of ``-i`` (and of PyPIFetcher's pypi_base)
  to match pip's ``-i``.  This is useful for compatibility with devpi.

------
0.5.10
------

* Ensures that .egg/.whl distributions on disk have their mtime updated
  even though we no longer overwrite them. This gives them a new time
  lease against their ttl.

  Without this change, once a distribution aged past the ttl it would
  never be used again, and builds would re-create the same distributions
  in tmpdirs over and over again.

-----
0.5.9
-----

* Fixes an issue where SourceTranslator would overwrite .egg/.whl
  distributions already on disk.  Instead it should always check to see if
  a copy already exists and reuse if there.

  This ordinarily should not be a problem but the zipimporter caches
  metadata by filename instead of stat/sha, so if the underlying contents
  changed a runtime error would be thrown due to seemingly corrupt zip file
  offsets. `RB #684 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/684/>`_

-----
0.5.8
-----

* Adds ``-i/--index`` option to the pex tool.

-----
0.5.7
-----

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.pex_bootstrap`` ``bootstrap_pex_env`` function in
  order to initialize a PEX environment from within a python interpreter.
  (Patch contributed by @kwlzn)

* Adds stdin=,stdout=,stderr= keyword parameters to the ``PEX.run`` function.
  (Patch from @benjy)

-----
0.5.6
-----

* The crawler now defaults to not follow links for security reasons.
  (Before the default behavior was to implicitly ``--follow-links`` for all
  requirements.) `RB #293 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/293/>`_

-----
0.5.5
-----

* Improves scrubbing of site-packages from PEX environments.
  `RB #289 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/289/>`_

-------------
0.5.1 - 0.5.4
-------------

* Silences exceptions reported during interpreter teardown (the exceptions
  resulting from incorrect atexit handler behavior) introduced by 0.4.3
  `RB #253 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/253/>`_
  `RB #249 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/249/>`_

* Adds ``__hash__`` to ``Link`` so that Packages are hashed correctly in
  ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve``

-----
0.5.0
-----

* Adds wheel support to ``twitter.common.python``
  `RB #94 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/94/>`_
  `RB #154 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/154/>`_
  `RB #148 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/148/>`_

-----
0.4.3
-----

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.finders`` which are additional finders for
  setuptools including:
  - find eggs within a .zip
  - find wheels within a directory
  - find wheels within a .zip
  `RB #86 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/86/>`_

* Adds a new Package abstraction by refactoring Link into Link and Package.
  `RB #92 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/92/>`_

* Adds support for PEP425 tagging necessary for wheel support.
  `RB #87 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/87/>`_

* Improves python environment isolation by correctly scrubbing namespace
  packages injected into module ``__path__`` attributes by nspkg pth files.
  `RB #116 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/116/>`_

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve`` method that handles
  transitive dependency resolution better.  This means that if the
  requirement ``futures==2.1.2`` and an unqualified ``futures>=2`` is pulled in
  transitively, our resolver will correctly resolve futures 2.1.2 instead
  of reporting a VersionConflict if any version newer than 2.1.2 is
  available. `RB #129 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/129/>`_

* Factors all ``twitter.common.python`` test helpers into
  ``twitter.common.python.testing``
  `RB #91 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/91/>`_

* Bug fix: Fix ``OrderedSet`` atexit exceptions
  `RB #147 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/147/>`_

* Bug fix: Fix cross-device symlinking (patch from @benjy)

* Bug fix: Raise a ``RuntimeError`` if we fail to write ``pkg_resources`` into a .pex
  `RB #115 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/115/>`_

-----
0.4.2
-----

* Upgrade to ``setuptools>=1``

-----
0.4.1
-----

* ``twitter.common.python`` is no longer a namespace package

-----
0.4.0

* Kill the egg distiller.  We now delegate .egg generation to bdist_egg.
  `RB #55 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/55/>`_

-----
0.3.1
-----

* Short-circuit resolving a distribution if a local exact match is found.
  `RB #47 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/47/>`_

* Correctly patch the global ``pkg_resources`` ``WorkingSet`` for the lifetime
  of the Python interpreter. `RB #52 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/52/>`_

* Fixes a performance regression in setuptools ``build_zipmanifest``
  `Setuptools Issue #154 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/154/build_zipmanifest-results-should-be>`_
  `RB #53 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/53/>`_

-----
0.3.0
-----

* Plumb through the ``--zip-safe``, ``--always-write-cache``, ``--ignore-errors``
  and ``--inherit-path`` flags to the pex tool.

* Delete the unused ``PythonDirWrapper`` code.

* Split ``PEXEnvironment`` resolution into ``twitter.common.python.environment``
  and deconflate ``WorkingSet``/``Environment`` state.

* Removes the monkeypatched zipimporter in favor of keeping all eggs
  unzipped within PEX files.  Refactors the PEX dependency cache in
  ``util.py``

* Adds interpreter detection for Jython and PyPy.

* Dependency translation errors should be made uniform.
  (Patch from @johnsirois)

* Adds ``PEX_PROFILE_ENTRIES`` to limit the number of entries reported when
  ``PEX_PROFILE`` is enabled. (Patch from @rgs_)

* Bug fix: Several fixes to error handling in ``twitter.common.python.http``
  (From Marc Abramowitz)

* Bug fix: PEX should not always assume that ``$PATH`` was available.
  (Patch from @jamesbroadhead)

* Bug fix: Filename should be part of the .pex cache key or else multiple
  identical versions will incorrectly resolve (Patch from @tc)

* Bug fix: Executed entry points shouldn't be forced to run in an
  environment with ``__future__`` imports enabled. (Patch from
  @lawson_patrick)

* Bug fix: Detect versionless egg links and fail fast. (Patch from
  @johnsirois.)

* Bug fix: Handle setuptools>=2.1 correctly in the zipimport monkeypatch
  (Patch from @johnsirois.)

  as a namespace package.

-----
0.2.0

  external dependencies within ``twitter.common.python.common``.
