===================
Pex Release Process
===================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Pre-requisites
==============

PGP
---

All release tags are signed (using ``git tag --sign``) so that users of Pex can verify maintainers
have performed & trust a release. This requires releasers having a PGP key configured with git and
published to key servers. An additional nicety is to configure you PGP key with GitHub for those who
like to check provenance via a web UI.

Some documentation to help you get things set up if you don't have all of these pre-requisites:

+ Creating a key and configuring your key with Git and GitHub is all described `here <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification>`_
+ Publishing your key to a keyserver is described `here <https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x457.html>`_

Some key servers you probably want to publish your key to explicitly above and beyond your PGP setup's
default configured keyserver include:

+ hkps://pgp.mit.edu
+ hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com
+ hkps://keys.openpgp.org
